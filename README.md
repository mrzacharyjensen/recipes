A basic static website for displaying recipes.
Optimised for desktop touch interface, also viewable on mobile.
Reads from `recipes.txt` file where recipes are grouped into categories in a markdown-esque format, where categories are prefaced with `# `, and recipes with `## `.
Exempli gratia:
```recipes.txt
# Category 1

## Recipe 1
Ingredient
Ingredient

## Recipe 2
Ingredient
Ingredient

# Category 2

## Recipe 2
Ingredient
Ingredient
```
